Welcome to our wonderful project

Our project is a scholarship portal, where the main entities are applicants who are linked to applications and the scholarship that they are applying to. Scholarships will either be issued on a one-time or a renewable basis (as seen from our ISA). Additionally, a scholarship cannot exist without a donor, and a scholarship committee will evaluate the applicant’s application. All entities are primarily identified by their respective IDs stored in the database. In the previous milestone, we added some entities to our ER diagram in order to fulfill the entity requirement as per our mentor’s suggestions, and we also added some attributes to each entity in order to form possible BCNF decompositions. Relational schema and working for decompositions was also included. SQL DDL statements were created and each table was populated with sample data.
